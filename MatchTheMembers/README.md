# MDB Meet the Members
The purpose of this app is to understand the basics of Xcode and also have an interactive way to learn the names of all the MDB members.

## Features
- Randomly selects a name and the picture associated with it
- Four buttons below the photo are displayed, one of which is the correct answer
- The correct answer is highlighted green and if the wrong one is chosen, it highlights red
- There’s a 5 second timer and if you don’t choose within that time, it will be counted as incorrect and it will continue to the next picture and set of choices
- For each correct answer, there is a streak number and the app keeps track of the longest streak
- User has access to a stats screen where they are able to view their longest streak and results of the last three questions (if they exist)
